# Splitrail

Blazing fast, single-executable, cross-platform, agentic development monitor.  Supports Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex (and more coming soon), and integrates with the Splitrail Leaderboard.

> [!WARNING]
> While support for both Gemini CLI and Codex **is** implemented, neither tool implements the necessary functionality to make them work with Splitrail: Codex does not output enough information to its recorded chat files, and Gemini CLI does not automatically record conversation history at all.  PRs are open for both, however: https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/1583 and https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4401.  React with :+1: on them to encourage them to be merged!

The Splitrail CLI can automatically upload usage data to the [Splitrail Leaderboard.](https://splitrail.dev/leaderboard)
